How to Fix error: failed to push some refs to Error in Git Using git pull --rebase
The git pull --rebase  command is helpful in situations where your local branch is a commit behind the remote branch.

To fix the error, go on and run following commands:

git pull --rebase origin main

git push -u origin main 
If the first command above runs successfully, you should get a response that says: Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/main.

The second command pushes your local repo's current state to the remote branch.
